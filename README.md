# SpringBootMVC project - SOFTWARE PROJECT 1 
Playlist Management System

## How do I run this ?

1. Get the zip file from ugla or github.
2. Set the project in eclipse (import the zip file as a Maven Project)
3. Download MySQL and create a db with name: pms, username: team20 and password: softproject1. Use port 3306 in the configuration. Other names, password and ports can be use if that is more convenient, but then the aplication.properties file has to be modified accordingly.
4. Download MySQLWorckbench for convenience.
5. Run the application from Eclipse, then
6. Using MySQLWorckbench import the songs.csv that is in the project folder. Do so by finding the db in the left menu: pms > Tables > song_info. Then right click on song_info and select Table Data Import Wizard. Browse the file to find the song.csv file, then click next until until the import has finished.
7. Now open a browser and go to: localhost:8080 and start using the application
